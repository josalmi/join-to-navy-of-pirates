## Task 1: Apache Spark

Make yourself familiar with Apache Spark (https://spark.apache.org/)

Dataset: https://github.com/emblica/sessionization/blob/master/events.json.tar.gz

- [] What is pyspark? How it is related to normal spark?
- [] Read JSON-lines with pyspark using pyspark shell (read https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html)
- [] Use Spark to execute custom SQL-queries on top of the JSON-data (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#running-sql-queries-programmatically)
- [] What is parquet?
- [] Save JSON-lines as parquet file
- [] Read Parquet-file of JSON-lines into spark
- [] Save aggregates where there is count of distinct events as JSON-lines (look what `coalesce()` and `repartition()` does)
